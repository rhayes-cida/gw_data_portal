		Welcome to the National <span class='ngwmn-highlight'>Groundwater</span><br />Monitoring Network (NGWMN) 
	</p>
	<p>
		The <span class='ngwmn-highlight'>National Groundwater
			Monitoring Network (NGWMN)</span> is a compilation of selected groundwater
		monitoring wells from Federal, State, and local groundwater monitoring
		networks across the nation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The NGWMN is a product of the Subcomittee on Groundwater of the
		federal Advisory Committee on Water Information (<a
			href='http://acwi.gov'>ACWI</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The <span class='ngwmn-highlight'>NGWMN Data Portal</span> provides
		access to groundwater data from multiple, dispersed databases in a
		web-based mapping application. The portal contains current and
		historical data including water levels, water quality, lithology, and
		well construction.
	</p>

<div id="ngwmn-water-level-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>Sites in the NGWMN are classified as being part of either the water-level network, the water-quality network or both.</p>
</div>

<div id="ngwmn-water-level-subnetwork-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>
	Sites in the water-level network will be designated as being in one of three subnetworks.
	These are 1) the Background subnetwork, 2) the Suspected Changes subnetwork, and 3) the
	Documented Changes subnetwork.
	</br>
	You can select one or more Water-Level Monitoring Categories as a filter criteria.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>Background subnetwork:</span>
			<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers or parts of aquifers with no (or minimal) anthropogenic effects.
			<p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Suspected Changes subnetwork:</span>
			<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers or parts of aquifers that may have been affected by man's activity, 
			but that is not documented or conclusive.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Documented Changes subnetwork:</span>
			<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers that have documented anthropogenic effects.

		</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div id="ngwmn-water-level-category-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>
	Wells are assigned a monitoring category (Trend or Surveillance) depending on the purpose of
	the monitoring at the well.
	</br>
	You can select one or more Water-level Monitoring Categories as a filter criteria.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>Trend:</span>
			<p>
			Trend wells are generally monitored to determine changes over time. The frequency of monitoring depends on the 
			hydrologic conditions of the aquifer and may vary.
			</p>
		<li>
			<span>Surveillance:</span>
			<p>
			Surveillance monitoring would be used in conjunction with Trend monitoring 
			to periodically provide a more detailed spatial snapshot of ground-water conditions. 
			The frequency of Surveillance monitoring generally is much less than Trend monitoring.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

<div id="ngwmn-water-quality-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>

<div id="ngwmn-aquifer-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>All NGWMN sites are associated with a single U.S. principal aquifer. Information on Principal
	Aquifers is available <a href="http://water.usgs.gov/ogw/aquiferbasics/alphabetical.html">here</a>.
	</br>
	You can select one or more Principal Aquifers as a filter criteria. Only those Principal Aquifers
	that have sites associated with the aquifer are shown in the selection list.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="ngwmn-agency-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>Each NGWMN site is associated with an agency. This could be the agency that samples the data
	or the agency that provides the data.
	</br>
	You can select one or more Contributing Agencies as a filter criteria. Only agencies that have
	sites associated with them are shown in the selection list.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="ngwmn-available-data-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>This filter restricts sites based on the data that is actually available for the sites on the portal;
	Water Level, Water Quality, or Well Logs. Selecting more than one of three filters will show only
	sites that have all types of data available. For example, sites with both water-level data and well logs.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="ngwmn-state-and-county-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>You can select one or more states as a filter criteria.
	</br>
	Alternatively, you can select one state and then select one or more counties within that State
	to be used as a filter criteria. Only those states and counties with the states that have sites
	associated with them are shown in the selection list.
	</p>
