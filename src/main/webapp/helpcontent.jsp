		Welcome to the National <span class='ngwmn-highlight'>Groundwater</span><br />Monitoring Network(NGWMN) 
	</p>
	<p>
		The <span class='ngwmn-highlight'>National Groundwater
			Monitoring Network (NGWMN)</span> is a compilation of selected "groundwater
		monitoring wells from Federal, State, and local groundwater monitoring
		networks across the nation.
	</p>
	<p>
		The NGWMN is a product of the Subcomittee on Groundwater of the
		federal Advisory Committee on Water Information (<a
			href='http://acwi.gov'>ACWI</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
		The <span class='ngwmn-highlight'>NGWMN Data Portal</span> provides
		access to groundwater data from multiple, "dispersed databases in a
		web-based mapping application. The portal contains current and
		historical data including "water levels, water quality, lithology, and
		well construction.
	</p>

	<p>Sites in the NGWMN are classified as being part of either the water level network, the water quality network or both.</p>
</div>

<div id="ngwmn-water-level-subnetwork-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>
	Sites water-level network will be designated as being in one of three subnetworks. These are 1) the Background subnetwork, 
	2) the Suspected Changes subnetwork, and 3) the Documented Changes subnetwork.
	</p>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>Background subnetwork:</span>
			<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers or parts of aquifers with no (or minimal) anthropogenic effects. 
			These are from areas that have been minimally affected by human activities and are expected to remain so.
			<p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Suspected Changes subnetwork:</span>
			<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers or parts of aquifers that may have been affected by man's activity, 
			but that is not documented or conclusive. These wells may also be in areas where changes are anticipated. These may 
			be areas with withdrawals are occurring or where land-use has changed, but the effect has not yet been clearly identified.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<span>Documented Changes subnetwork:</span>
			<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers that have documented anthropogenic effects.<br/>
			The aquifers may:<br/>
			(1) be known to be heavily pumped, or<br/>
			(2) have experienced substantial recharge-altering land-use changes, or<br/>
			(3) have managed ground-water resources, or<br/>
			(4) are known to have degraded water quality or declining  water levels.

<div id="ngwmn-water-level-category-tip" class='x-hidden ngwmn-help-tip'>
	<p>
	Wells within each water-level subnetwork (Background, Suspected Changes, or Documented Changes) will be assigned to a monitoring category 
	depending on the purpose of the monitoring at the well. These categories, and conditions at the wells, will be used to determine 
	suggested monitoring frequencies.
	</p>

	<p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<span>Trend:</span>
			<p>
			Trend wells are generally monitored to determine changes over time. The frequency of monitoring depends on the 
			hydrologic conditions of the aquifer and can range from daily data to annual measurements. A subset of the trend 
			monitoring wells will be designated as the “backbone” wells of the NGWMN.
			</p>
		<li>
			<span>Surveillance:</span>
			<p>
			Surveillance monitoring would be used in conjunction with Trend monitoring to periodically report on the 
			overall water-level and water-quality conditions, or status, of the Nation's ground-water resources. NGWMN 
			surveillance monitoring can be thought of as a periodic "census" of ground-water level and quality. An overall 
			snapshot of ground-water conditions in an aquifer is obtained with Surveillance monitoring. The frequency of 
			Surveillance monitoring generally is much less than Trend monitoring.
