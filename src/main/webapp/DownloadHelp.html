<h1>Download Help</h1>
<p>Data for one or more sites may be downloaded for analysis.</p>
<p>The data download is available from the "Site Identification"
tool, for download of data from one site, or from the "Multi-Site
Download Tool", for data from multiple sites.</p>

<h2>Single-Site Download</h2>
<p>At present, data for a single site is available as an XLS
(Microsoft &reg; Excel &reg; format) file, with three sheets: 
<ul>
<li>Well Log
<li>Water Levels
<li>Water Quality
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Well Log sheet contains both Lithology and Construction
information.</p>

<p>The format for the single-site download will soon change to be
identical to that for the Multi-Site Download (q.v.).</p>

<h2>Multi-Site Download</h2>

<p>The multi-site download tool provides data for all the sites
visible on the map, which can be controlled using the agency,
aquifer, and network selection filters (in the left sidebar of the
map) and the drag and zoom tools.</p>

<p>The download tool allows you to choose which data categories to download for
the visible sites, choosing from: 
<ul>
<li>Water Level
<li>Water Quality
<li>Construction
<li>Lithology
</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The data is downloaded as a zip file, containing one CSV
(comma-separated values) file for each selected data category; the
columns in each CSV file are labeled with column headers. The columns
are separated by the comma character (ASCII 44), data is delimited by
the quote character (ASCII 34), and each row of data is terminated by
a linefeed character (ASCII 10).</p>

<p>The zip file also contains a REGISTRY.csv file, giving general information about all the visible sites.</p>
