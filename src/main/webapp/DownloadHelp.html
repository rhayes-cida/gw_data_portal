<p>Data for one or more sites may be downloaded for analysis.</p>
<p>The data download is available from the "Site Identification"
tool, for download of data from one site, or from the "Multi-Site
Download Tool", for data from multiple sites.</p>

<h2>Single-Site Download</h2>

When investigating a single site, the data may be viewed on-line, 
in a pop-up window with separate tabs for different data types
(as available for a particular site),
or may be downloaded as a single file containing all available 
data types.

<h2>Multi-Site Download</h2>

<p>The multi-site download tool provides data for all the sites
visible on the map, which can be controlled using the agency,
aquifer, and network selection filters (in the left sidebar of the
map) and the drag and zoom tools.</p>

<p>The download tool allows you to choose which data categories to download for
the visible sites, choosing from: 
<ul>
<li>Water Level
<li>Water Quality
<li>Construction
<li>Lithology
</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Data Format</h2>

<p>The data is downloaded as a zip file, containing one CSV
(comma-separated values) file for each selected data category; the
columns in each CSV file are labeled with column headers. The columns
are separated by the comma character (ASCII 44), data is delimited by
the quote character (ASCII 34), and each row of data is terminated by
a linefeed character (ASCII 10).</p>

<p>The zip file also contains a REGISTRY.csv file, giving general information about all the visible sites.</p>
