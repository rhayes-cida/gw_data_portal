The NGWMN Data Portal is the access point for information about the wells in this network and for their related 
lithology (geology), construction, water-level and water-quality data. To access the portal <a href="index.jsp">click here</a>.
</p>
</br>
<p>
An important aspect of the NGWMN Data Portal is that it is not an aggregated database of data from all 
participants, but is a gateway to the data as it is maintained and served by each participating organization. 
Original data are retrieved from each data provider by the portal in real-time.

<p>
The Data Portal has filters and map-based selection capabilities that allow the
user to select the sites of interest. After the sites are selected, requests are
sent to the contributing databases serving the selected sites to obtain the data.
This data is then returned via the portal in graphs and tables and can also be
downloaded for later use.
</p>
</br>
<p>
Queries can be made on network type, well classification, and monitoring
category. Sites can also be queried based on principal aquifer, type of data
available, contributing agency, and state/county.
