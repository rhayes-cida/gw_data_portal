<p>
The NGWMN Data Portal is the access point for information about the wells in this network and for their related 
lithology (geology), construction, water-level and water-quality data. 
</p>

<p>
An important aspect of the NGWMN Data Portal is that it is not an aggregated database of data from all 
participants, but is a gateway to the data as it is maintained and served by each participating organization. 
Original data are retrieved from each data provider by the portal in real time. More information about 
the network and the data portal can be found <a href="#aboutNetwork" onclick="GWDP.ui.learnMoreTabs.show(0); return false;">here</a>.
