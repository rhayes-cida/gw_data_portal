<p>
The NGWMN network is sponsored by the Advisory Committee on Water Information's (<a href="http://acwi.gov">ACWI</a>) 
Subcommittee on Ground Water (<a href="http://acwi.gov/sogw">SOGW</a>) and was established in 2009 with a pilot network. 
</p>
<p>
The goal of the National Ground Water Monitoring Network (NGWMN) is to provide information needed for planning, 
management, and development of ground-water supplies to meet current and future water needs and ecosystem requirements. 
This will be accomplished by aggregating suitable ground-water data from local, state, and federal organizations. 
A consensus-based framework document (<a href="http://acwi.gov/sogw/pubs/tr/index.html">http://acwi.gov/sogw/pubs/tr/index.html</a>) 
was developed to provide guidance to ensure that the data are comparable and can be included in a nationally consistent network. 
The framework design focuses on providing information needed to assess the quantity of ground-water reserves as constrained by quality. 
The scale of the network focuses on Principal and Major Aquifers of the United States.</p>

<p id="design" class="ngwmn-section-title">Network Design</p>

<p>
The network is composed of selected wells from existing federal, multistate, state, tribal, and local ground-water 
monitoring networks. The scale of the network will focus on Principal and Major Aquifers of the United States. Well 
classification subnetworks and monitoring categories are defined in the framework document 
(<a href="http://acwi.gov/sogw/pubs/tr/index.html">http://acwi.gov/sogw/pubs/tr/index.html</a>) and are briefly described here:
</p>

<p class="ngwmn-sub-section-title">
Well Classification Subnetworks:
</p>

<p>
Wells in the NGWMN will be designated as being in one of three subnetworks. These are 1) the Background subnetwork, 
2) the Suspected Changes subnetwork, and 3) the Documented Changes subnetwork.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<span>Background subnetwork:</span>
		<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers or parts of aquifers with no (or minimal) anthropogenic effects. 
		These are from areas that have been minimally affected by human activities and are expected to remain so.
		<p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span>Suspected Changes subnetwork:</span>
		<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers or parts of aquifers that may have been affected by man's activity, 
		but that is not documented or conclusive. These wells may also be in areas where changes are anticipated. These may 
		be areas with withdrawals are occurring or where land-use has changed, but the effect has not yet been clearly identified.
		</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<span>Documented Changes subnetwork:</span>
		<p>Monitoring points that provide data from aquifers that have documented anthropogenic effects.<br/>
		The aquifers may:<br/>
		(1) be known to be heavily pumped<br/>
		(2) have experienced substantial recharge-altering land-use changes<br/>
		(3) have managed ground-water resources<br/>
		(4) are known to have degraded water quality or declining  water levels
		</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="ngwmn-sub-section-title">
Baseline Process:
</p>

<p>
The baseline process is required of all wells to provide or identify an initial monitoring record that is used to place 
the well into one of the above subnetworks. Five years of monitoring is generally considered adequate to establish these 
conditions. For existing wells, past data may be used to categorize wells into one of the subnetworks.

<p class="ngwmn-sub-section-title">
Monitoring Categories:
</p>

<p>
Wells within each subnetwork (Background, Suspected Changes, or Documented Changes) will be assigned to a monitoring category 
depending on the purpose of the monitoring at the well. These categories, and conditions at the wells, will be used to determine 
suggested monitoring frequencies.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<span>Trend:</span>
		<p>
		Trend wells are generally monitored to determine changes over time. The frequency of monitoring depends on the 
		hydrologic conditions of the aquifer and can range from daily data to annual measurements. A subset of the trend 
		monitoring wells will be designated as the “backbone” wells of the NGWMN.
		</p>
	<li>
		<span>Surveillance:</span>
		<p>Surveillance monitoring would be used in conjunction with Trend monitoring to periodically report on the 
		overall water-level and water-quality conditions, or status, of the Nation's ground-water resources. NGWMN 
		Surveillance monitoring can be thought of as a periodic "census" of ground-water level and quality. An overall 
		snapshot of ground-water conditions in an aquifer is obtained with Surveillance monitoring. The frequency of 
		Surveillance monitoring generally is much less than Trend monitoring.

Network Status
</p>

<p>
A pilot phase that started in 2009 initially populated the network with data from 5 pilot networks. These pilots were: 
the Mahomet-Teays aquifer in Illinois and Indiana, the Cambrian-Ordovician aquifer in southeastern Minnesota, and statewide 
aquifers in Montana, New Jersey, and Texas.
</p>

<p>
Following the pilot phase, additional USGS water-level monitoring wells that met the network critieria were added to the NGWMN
for some states. Work continues in adding more USGS wells from the remaining states and adding available USGS water-quality data. </p>
