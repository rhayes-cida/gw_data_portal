The <span class="ngwmn-highlight">NGWMN</span> is in transition from a pilot phase into full implementation. Contact the ACWI
Subcommittee on Ground Water (link here) to find out how you can help. We hope to begin
adding additional data providers to the network soon. Check back here for information about
how you can get data from your groundwater monitoring network into the NGWMN.
